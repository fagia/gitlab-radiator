# The missing GitLab build radiator view

## Introduction

```gitlab-radiator``` is a small Node.js application for serving a [Jenkins Radiator View](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Radiator+View+Plugin) inspired web view of your team's CI pipelines fetched from a GitLab CI installation running locally or remotely.

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/heikkipora/gitlab-radiator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heikkipora/gitlab-radiator)

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js v5.0.0 or newer
- A modern web browser
- An account in https://gitlab.com or an onsite installation of the [GitLab software package](https://about.gitlab.com/products).

## Installation

    npm install -g gitlab-radiator

## Usage

Create a configuration file (see [Configuration](#configuration) below) and run:

    gitlab-radiator

And if you have an onsite GitLab with HTTPS and self-signed certificates:

    NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 gitlab-radiator

You might prefer providing the CA file location in configuration instead of totally disabling TLS certificate checking.

Then navigate with a browser to http://localhost:3000 - or whatever port you did configure.

## Usage with Docker

### Build with Docker

    docker build --tag gitlab-radiator .

### Run with Docker

    docker run \
        --publish <a_port>:3000 \
        --volume <path_to_.gitlab-radiator.yml>:/home/node/.gitlab-radiator.yml \
        --volume <optional_path_to_custom.css>:/home/node/custom.css \
        --volume <optional_path_to_custom.js>:/home/node/custom.js \
        gitlab-radiator

## Configuration

```gitlab-radiator``` looks for its mandatory configuration file at ```~/.gitlab-radiator.yml``` by default.
It can be overridden by defining the ```GITLAB_RADIATOR_CONFIG``` environment variable.

Configuration properties:

- ```gitlab / url``` (mandatory) - Root URL of your GitLab installation - or that of GitLab SaaS CI
- ```gitlab / projectsUrl``` (mandatory) - URL for projects source, eg. ```/projects``` or ```/group/:id/projects```
- ```gitlab / groupName``` (mandatory) - gitlab group name to use as projects source. It's alternative to projectsUrl
- ```gitlab / access-token``` (mandatory or env variable) - A GitLab access token for allowing access to the GitLab API. One can be generated with GitLab's UI under Profile Settins / Personal Access Tokens. If this property is not specified, it's mandatory to define an environment variable named `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- ```projects / include``` (optional) - Regular expression for inclusion of projects. Default is to include all projects.
- ```projects / exclude``` (optional) - Regular expression for exclusion of projects. Default is to exclude no projects.
- ```projects / order``` (optional) - Array of projects attributes to use for sorting projects. Default value is ['name'].
- ```interval``` (optional) - Number of seconds between updateing projects and pipelines from GitLab. Default value is 10 seconds.
- ```port``` (optional) - HTTP port to listen on. Default value is 3000.
- ```zoom``` (optional) - View zoom factor (to make your projects fit a display nicely). Default value is 1.0
- ```columns``` (optional) - Number of columns to display (to fit more projects on screen). Default value is 1
- ```caFile``` (optional) - CA file location to be passed to the request library when accessing your gitlab instance.
- ```auth / username``` (optional) - Enables HTTP basic authentication with the defined username and password.
- ```auth / password``` (optional) - Enables HTTP basic authentication with the defined username and password.
- ```header / title``` (optional) - Text to be displayed in header as title.
- ```header / subtitle``` (optional) - Text to be displayed in header as subtitle.
- ```header / image``` (optional) - Image URL to be displayed in the header.
- ```customCss``` (optional) - CSS file path to be used to customize the look of the page.
- ```customJs``` (optional) - JS file path to be used to customize the the page behaviour.

Example yaml syntax:

```
gitlab:
  access-token: 12invalidtoken12
  url: https://gitlab.com
projects:
  exclude: .*/.*-inactive-project
  order: ['status', 'name']
auth:
  username: 'radiator'
  password: 'p455w0rd'
interval: 30
port: 8000
zoom: 0.85
columns: 4
header:
  title: 'a title'
  subtitle: 'a subtitle'
  image: 'https://picsum.photos/250/150'
customCss: '/path/to/a/file.css'
customJs: '/path/to/a/file.js'
```

## Breaking changes from 1.x to 2.0

- Configuration file syntax has changed so that there's only a single ```interval``` property instead of two nested ones.
